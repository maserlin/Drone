Drone scratchcard game

Many rough edges and I won't win a prize for graphic design.
Major todos are motion easing and bulletproofing the click/tap interactions. 
There are some scaling issues and this has only been run in device emulators (Chrome).
I decided to make this into a scratchcard game. You get 5 "missiles" each of which reveals a prize.
Match 3 or more prizes to win the amount. Maths is in the profile.xml.
There are stubs for server comms but no server virtual or otherwise, though it would be straightforward to continue development of this.

Sorry this has taken so long, I've been mired in a tricky support call at work which has necessarily taken priority.
